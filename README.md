This calculator application has an added unit converter for length, mass, and time, alongside standard arithmetic operations. While the converter has drop-down menus for unit selection, the HTML framework provides an input field and buttons for calculator functions. The CSS provides the styles for dark mode. JavaScript is used to fill in options for unit conversion, handle arithmetic operations, and make conversions based on given conversion factors. Well, one of the challenges was how, if the user chooses units of different types, to ensure a correct conversion. This was done through conversion factors with respect to base units of meters, grams, and seconds. The unit options are refreshed dynamically by event listeners according to user input and perform all conversions.
